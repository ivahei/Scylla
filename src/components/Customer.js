          <p>
            We have conducted tests alongside other solutions, as well as
            various handheld thermometers. Overall we are pleased with the
            performance of the product. We are especially pleased with the
            service and support from Scylla. Scylla was very supportive in
            meeting our requirements pertaining to technology, logistics, and
            product.
          </p>

            Describe specific points you are satisfied with the performance of
            the software and the relevant features
          </h3>
          <p>
            We like the product because of its: consistency, flexibility, and
            productivity. We conducted a statistical sampling and comparison of
            means and determined that the Scylla product correlated with others.
            We like the Scylla product because of its flexible features and the
            fact that the product is agnostic to the camera unit. One can
            customize one’s needs by using either a standard camera or a more
            sophisticated camera unit. Finally, the Scylla product allows us to
            be more productive by freeing up manpower that was originally used
            to manually take temperatures of incoming personnel into our sites.
          </p>

            P.S From Customer - A positive experience endorsement from a
            Globally respected company such as Oman Airport is invaluable to
            gaining confidence from other organizations who may not be familiar
            with Scylla.
