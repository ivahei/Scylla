          was deployed at various locations of Oman Airports in Oman. The
          objective was to run temperature checks at the entrance of the
          facility. The thermal scanning process was expected to be hassle-free,
          non-contact, and fast. The system was adjusted to the requested
          alerting/reporting flow.
